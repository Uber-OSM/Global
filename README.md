# NewDelhi

# Overview 
Uber sees OSM as a valuable tool and uses it in internal models to help determine time + distance estimates for fare calculation and to optimize driver and rider matching. In certain circumstances, we are able to observe that road directionality and turn restrictions are not up-to-date. We plan to explore these issues and, where appropriate, submit updates to correct the issue. We have selected the Delhi NCR region as the first city for this initiative. 

We do not plan to make any large-scale, machine-generated edits for this project. All edits will be made by a small team of individuals based in Palo Alto, California, USA. The team will be using the available data sources in the JOSM tool for their corrections and validations. We will share the profiles of our editors on Uberâ€™s OSM page. The edits will be made according to the Organized Editing Best Practices and India guidelines. In addition, Uber employees based in Delhi will be able to participate in this project by leveraging their local knowledge to help identify data issues. 

For this project, our team will focus on adding and modifying the following OSM features: 
Turn restriction.
Directionality.
Road Geometry.

Please feel free to reach out to us with feedback, questions, and suggestions at OSM@uber.com. 

We are looking forward to this collaboration.
